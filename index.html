<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This policy applies to all utilities developed by PFSmarter and distributed on Apple’s App Store.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>We do not collect, store, sell, or share personal data.</strong> Our applications run locally on your device. Any data you input (e.g., calculator values) remains on your device and is not transmitted to us.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Analytics/tracking:</strong> None.</li>
  <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> None are sent to us. If you have opted into Apple's diagnostic settings, those are governed by Apple's privacy policy.</li>
  <li><strong>Accounts/sign-in:</strong> Not required.</li>
  <li><strong>Payments:</strong> All payments are handled by Apple; we do not receive any of your payment card data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no server-side retention. Any values you save within the app stay on your device until you delete the application or reset its data.</p>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>We do not integrate any third-party advertising or analytics SDKs. App distribution and purchases are provided by Apple. Please refer to Apple’s privacy policies for platform-level data.</p>

<h2>Open Source Licenses</h2>
<p>Our applications may use third-party libraries and components under the following open-source licenses:</p>
<p><strong>BSD 3-Clause License</strong></p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Because we do not process personal data, typical data subject requests (access, deletion, portability) do not apply. If you have any questions, please contact us at <span class="mono">pfsmarter@gmail.com</span>.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Our utilities are intended for general audiences and do not specifically target children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy to reflect product or legal changes. The "Effective date" above will be revised and the latest version will be posted at this URL.</p>
